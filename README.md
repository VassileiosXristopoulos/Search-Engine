This is a System Programming project. A virtual search engine is implemented, where a file is given and the user can search with keywords, and get the lines with the higher percentage of those words in descending order (feature 1). Furthermore, other features are included such as getting a list of all the words of the file along with their line appearance frequency (feature 2), and searching how many times a word appears in a certain document (feature 3).
Commands:

1)Run: "./minisearch -i docfile -k K" (k is how many results will feature 1 print)
2)feature 1: "/search <word1> <word2> <word3> ... <word10>" (10 is the limit of words in a query)
3)feature 2: "/df" OR "/df <word>"
4)freture 3: "/tf <doc_id> <word>"
5)"./exit"
